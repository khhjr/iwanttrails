I specialize in machine built trails and offer turnkey solutions. But I'll work with you depending on your desired level of involvement and your budget. For example, a roughed in trail costs about 1/2 of what a completed trail does. So, you can save a lot of money by performing the hand work required to finish up. The following slides and gallery show examples of my work. References available upon request.
